# Examples for Hamburg and Oslo

## How to use
The run_{}.py skripts execute the complete programm from data preparation (prep_{}.py) to the core algorithm (algorithm_{}.py) to result plotting (plot_{}.py).  

Depending on the settings, it can take several hours to finish. For example with an AMD Ryzen 7 3700X it takes for Hamburg between 9.5 minutes 2.5 hours to finish, for Oslo between 2.5 and 47 minutes.

In the params.py you can change the relevant parameters for the preparation, calculation and plotting. In the paths.py the paths for storing the data, plots, etc. can be defined. If no parameters or paths are given to the functions, default parameters and paths are generated by the functions them self.
